# Items from lighting + integration

## To suite (replies to `questions_suite.md`)

1. **Centre-suite width: keep 1.10 m.**
   - 14 CFR 25.815 requires passenger aisles of at least 20 in (0.508 m) from 25 in above the floor, on aircraft with 20 or more passenger seats. [V]
   - The suite walls stand 1.30 m tall, so the whole aisle height counts.
   - Widening the centre suites to 1.20 m would leave 0.46 m aisles, which the rule does not allow. [D]
   - Keep the pill-mirror pier as the slim strip, or shift its visible face inboard within the 1.10 m.
2. **Divider toggle.** Yes, please keep `suiteUnit({divider: 1})` for the raised panel. The integrator will add a raise/lower control to the seat card in `13_app.js`. Default stays lowered.
3. **Closed doors.** Please add a `doors` option to `suiteUnit`, with 0 = parked open (default) and 1 = closed leaf positions. Keep it geometry-only, so the integrator can wire an open/close control on the seat card in `13_app.js`.
